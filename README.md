# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.  Therefore, youâ€™ll need to use different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. You will use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling to predict credit risk.

You will **oversample** the data using the `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms, and **undersample** the data using the `ClusterCentroids` alogirithm with logistic regression model.  Then, you will use a combinatorial approach of **over-and undersampling** using the `SMOTEENN` algorithm with logistic regression model.  Finally, you will compare two machine learning models `BalancedRandomForestClassifer` and `EasyEnsembleClassifier` hope to reduce bias for predicting credit risk.

## Results:
We analyse the balanced accuracy score, the precision and recall scores on the **high_risk** class from each model, as our target is to find a model that can better predict the high credit risk.

1) Oversampling using RandomOverSampler:
    * balanced accuracy score: 65.73%
    * precision and recall scores: The precision for **high_risk** is 0.01, and the recall for **high_risk** is 0.71, and the F1 score is 0.02.

2) Oversampling using SMOTE:

6) Easy Ensemble Classifier:
    * balanced accuracy score: 93.17%
    * precision and recall scores: The precision for **high_risk** is 0.09, and the recall for **high_risk** is 0.92, and the F1 score is 0.16.

## Summary:
* The balanced accuracy score for the models using oversampling/undersampling/over-and-undersampling are between 54.43% and 68.76%:
    * The SMOTEENN algorithm has the highest balanced accuracy score (68.76%) among this 4 models.
    * The Cluster Centroids algorithm has the lowest balanced accuracy score (54.43%) among this 4 models.
    * All 4 models have very low precision for **high_risk** class (0.01), and the recall for **high_risk** class is between 0.57 and 0.71.
* The **Balance Random Forest Classifier** and **Easy Ensemble Classifier** have very high balanced accuracy score and recall for **high_risk** class:
    * Balanced accuracy score: (1) Balance Random Forest --> 95.54%,  (2) Easy Ensemble --> 93.17%
    * Recall for **high_risk** class: (1) Balance Random Forest --> 1.00, (2) Easy Ensemble --> 0.92
* The precision for **high_risk** class are still low: **Balance Random Forest** (0.06) and **Easy Ensemble** (0.09)
* In overall, **Balanced Random Forest Classifier** has the highest balanced accuracy score of 95.54%, and also has the highest recall for **high_risk** of 1.00.  On the other hand, **Easy Ensemble Classifier** has the highest precision for **high_risk** of 0.09, and the highest F1 score (0.16) on high_risk class
* Since the sensitivity on predicting high risk class is the most important factor when considering a model for credit risk prediction, the **Balanced Random Forest Classifier** has the amazing 1.00 on the recall for **high_risk** class (i.e. it can predict ALL cases as "high_risk" which are actually in "high_risk" class!), and this model also has very high balanced accuracy score (95.54%), I will recommend the **Balanced Random Forest Classifier** as the model to predict credit risk based on the existing dataset.
