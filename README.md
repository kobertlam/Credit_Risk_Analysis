# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.  Therefore, youâ€™ll need to use different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. You will use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling to predict credit risk.

You will **oversample** the data using the `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms, and **undersample** the data using the `ClusterCentroids` alogirithm with logistic regression model.  Then, you will use a combinatorial approach of **over-and undersampling** using the `SMOTEENN` algorithm with logistic regression model.  Finally, you will compare two machine learning models `BalancedRandomForestClassifer` and `EasyEnsembleClassifier` hope to reduce bias for predicting credit risk.

## Results:
We analyse the balanced accuracy score, the precision and recall scores on the **high_risk** class from each model, as our target is to find a model that can predict the high credit risk.

* RandomOverSampler:
    * balance accuracy score: 65.73%
    * precision and recall scores: The precision for **high_risk** is 0.01, and the recall for **high_risk** is 0.71, and the F1 score is 0.02.

## Summary:
* Summarize the results of the machine learning models,
* include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
