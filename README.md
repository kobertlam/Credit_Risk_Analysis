# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.  Therefore, youâ€™ll need to use different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. You will use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling to predict credit risk.

You will **oversample** the data using the `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms, and **undersample** the data using the `ClusterCentroids` alogirithm.  Then, you will use a combinatorial approach of **over-and undersampling** using the `SMOTEENN` algorithms.  Finally, you will compare two machine learning models `BalancedRandomForestClassifer` and `EasyEnsembleClassifier` hope to reduce bias for predicting credit risk.

## Data Source:
Credit card credit dataset from [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/), a peer-to-peer lending services company

## Deliverables:
Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis

## Results:
* Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models.
* Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary:
* Summarize the results of the machine learning models,
* include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
